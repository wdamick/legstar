<title>Mainframe Proxy generation</title>
<para>
  The last step is also similar to the previous use case. We start by creating a mapping to the Web Service
  operation using the LegStar->New operations mapping… option:
</para>
<figure>
<title>Proxy service generation screen new operation</title>
<mediaobject>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="images/eclipse-screen-shot-proxy-service-generation-new-operation.jpg" format="JPG" scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%"/>
</imageobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>
<para>
  We now add an operation with the following characteristics: 
</para>
<figure>
<title>Proxy service generation screen operation mapping done</title>
<mediaobject>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="images/eclipse-screen-shot-proxy-service-generation-operation-mapping-done.jpg" format="JPG" scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%"/>
</imageobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>
<para>
  The mainframe program in this case is a sample COBOL CICS program that will be generated with
  the name that you specify here.
</para>
<para>
  Once you are back on the operations mapping editor, you can click on generate. You can now select the
  mainframe proxy option:
</para>
<figure>
<title>Proxy service generation screen select target</title>
<mediaobject>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="images/eclipse-screen-shot-proxy-service-generation-select-target.jpg" format="JPG" scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%"/>
</imageobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>
<para>
  The generator dialog will ask you for the target Web Service runtime characteristics. This is needed to
  allow the proxy to address the target Web Service at runtime. You can query these parameters from the WSDL
  again by entering the URL and clicking on go. If the target WSDL has more than one service or port,
  you will have to select one:
</para>
<figure>
<title>Proxy service generation screen parameters</title>
<mediaobject>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="images/eclipse-screen-shot-proxy-service-generation-parameters.jpg" format="JPG" scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%"/>
</imageobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>
<para>
  Clicking the finish button will create various artifacts. The Mainframe proxy is Servlet to be deployed in
  a J2EE container. The implementation uses Sun's JAX-WS RI (Metro) as a Web Service client. The build-war.xml
  ant file that is generated allows you to bundle the servlet ready for deployment.
</para>
<para>
  The generator also creates a sample COBOL program that behaves as an HTTP client. The search structure shows
  up in the working storage section:
</para>
<figure>
<title>Proxy service generation screen results</title>
<mediaobject>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="images/eclipse-screen-shot-proxy-service-generation-result.jpg" format="JPG" scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%"/>
</imageobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>
<para>
  The sample COBOL source contains TODO comments to help you locate where you should set values for the search
  request and where you can display the results. The LIVE search service requires a developer ID that you can
  get for free and enter in the AppID field.
</para>
<para>
  This is an example of code to set the search structures properly:
</para>
<programlisting>
           MOVE ZERO TO Flags--C OF COM-REQUEST.
           MOVE ZERO TO SortBy--C OF COM-REQUEST.
           MOVE ZERO TO ResultFields--C OF COM-REQUEST.
           MOVE ZERO TO R-string--C OF COM-REQUEST.
           MOVE 1 TO SourceRequest--C OF COM-REQUEST.
      *  You should specify your own Microsoft LIVE application ID
           MOVE '5588C3ACE949317B3ECAADDQ908611BDF5D8D5ZA'
             TO AppID OF COM-REQUEST.
           MOVE 'Mainframe' TO Query OF COM-REQUEST.
           MOVE 'en-US' TO CultureInfo OF COM-REQUEST.
           MOVE 'Moderate' to SafeSearch OF COM-REQUEST.
           MOVE ZERO TO Latitude OF COM-REQUEST.
           MOVE ZERO TO Longitude OF COM-REQUEST.
           MOVE ZERO TO Radius OF COM-REQUEST.
           MOVE 'Web' TO R-Source OF COM-REQUEST(1).
           MOVE ZERO TO Offset OF COM-REQUEST(1).
           MOVE 1 TO R-Count OF COM-REQUEST(1).
           MOVE SPACES TO FileType OF COM-REQUEST(1).
</programlisting>
<para>
  And these are lines to display the result:
</para>
<programlisting>
           STRING 'INVOKE-SERVICE success. First hit is '
                  DELIMITED BY SIZE
                  Description OF COM-REPLY(1, 1)
                  DELIMITED BY SIZE
                  INTO ERROR-MESSAGE.
           EXEC CICS SEND TEXT FROM(ERROR-MESSAGE) FREEKB END-EXEC.
           DISPLAY 'Response data length=' WBCLI-RESPONSE-BODY-LEN.

           DISPLAY 'SourceResponse--C ='
                    SourceResponse--C OF COM-REPLY.
           DISPLAY 'R-Source(1)=' R-Source OF COM-REPLY(1).
           DISPLAY 'Total(1)=' Total OF COM-REPLY(1).
           DISPLAY 'R-Title(1, 1)=' R-Title OF COM-REPLY(1, 1).
           DISPLAY 'Description(1, 1)='
                    Description OF COM-REPLY(1, 1).
</programlisting>
<para>
  After you add these lines of code, you should be able to upload the source onto your mainframe and get
  it compiled and defined to your CICS region. Please note that this program calls the CICS DFHWBCLI program
  defined in the CICS standard DFHWEB group. Alternatively, LegStar supports the new EXEC CICS WEB API or
  even supports older version of CICS with its own HTTP library.
